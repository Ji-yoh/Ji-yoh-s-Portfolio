# Ji-yoh-s-Portfolio

A portfolio page for a current bootcamp student who just learned HTML and CSS showing a description about themselves, links to recent projects, and contact info. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Development
```
Referred to MDN documents to implement grid layout for main structure of the page. Within the grid areas used flexboxes to organize items. Referred to past challenges to get ideas on styling. Decided to make banner disappear on smaller pages.

The intent is to refine the styling as skills get more refined but basic functionality should be added. Currently a tribute to Geocities.
